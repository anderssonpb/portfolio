#PORTFOLIO

As part of the learning process for Rocketseat's Full Stack Developer course. I'm going to develop projects related to what I'm learning and how these technologies are increasing my knowledge and complementing the gap I have in front-end and back-end development, to become a developer. 

The first stage is basically learning HTML and CSS so that I can familiarize myself with the tags.
